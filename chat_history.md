I see the issue with the Streamlit deployment. The error is coming from Poetry trying to install your project as a package but not finding the package configuration. Let's fix that immediately and get your app deployed to Streamlit Cloud.

First, let's fix the Poetry package configuration by updating your pyproject.toml file:

pyproject.toml+2-1
Let's continue by creating a __init__.py file for the data directory to make it a proper Python package. This will help with the imports and make our project structure cleaner for deployment:

__init__.py+1-1
Now that we've fixed the package configuration in pyproject.toml and created the proper Python package structure, let's also create a requirements.txt file as a fallback for Streamlit Cloud. This ensures that if Poetry has any issues, Streamlit can still install dependencies directly:

requirements.txt+4-1
Now that we've fixed the Poetry configuration issue by adding the packages field in pyproject.toml, let's also create a streamlit-specific configuration file to ensure the deployment runs smoothly. This will help Streamlit Cloud better understand how to run your application:

config.toml+14-1
Now let's make sure we have a proper README.md file that explains the project, which will be helpful for both deployment and submission:

README.md+41-3
Finally, let's create a clear package structure so Poetry can correctly identify and install our project. I'll create a standard Python package structure with an __init__.py file at the root level:

__init__.py+1-1
I've created all the necessary files to fix the Streamlit Cloud deployment issue. Here's what I've done:

Updated the pyproject.toml to include proper package configuration
Created a requirements.txt file as a fallback for Streamlit Cloud
Added Streamlit-specific configuration under config.toml
Created __init__.py files to properly structure the Python package
Updated the README.md with project details
Now your project should be properly structured for Streamlit Cloud deployment. The error was occurring because Poetry was trying to install your project as a package but couldn't find the package configuration.
